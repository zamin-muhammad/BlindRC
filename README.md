# BlindRC
Code for the RC car for blind people. Implementation available on my Linkedln (www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-zamin-476666332) and YouTube channel (https://youtu.be/IYeJ-AZeZ90). The car features a robotic arm you wear and control the car using it. The car guides you through viberations by the cast.
